# CS 4620 K-pop Database

## Getting Started

To run the program, follow these steps:

### Prerequisites
Node is installed

### Steps
Navigate to `electron-app` folder in the terminal

Run `npm i` to install dependencies

If sqlite3 is not alreayd installed, run `npm install sqlite3 --save`

Navigate to `src` and decompress `assets.zip`

Navigate back to `electron-app`, then to `backend`

Run `npm start` to start running the database (leave this tab open)

Open a new terminal and navigate back to `electron-app`

Here there are two options: 

* To run as a desktop application:

    * Run `npm start` and a window will pop up with the application

* To run as a web application

    * Run `ng serve`
    * Go to `http://localhost:4200/` in a web browser

There is not a reason to choose one over the other, my original plan was to create a desktop application but I found that it can also be run easily as a webapp.
